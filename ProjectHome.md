A program that graphically demonstrates the interactions of a memory trace with specific virtual memory settings (frame and physical memory sizes).

Building improvements on top of MOSS source base.

**Current roadmap:**

1.0 MOSS source fixing only deprecated APIs and Eclipse warnings. _**DONE**_

1.1 Separate CLI and GUI interfaces. General code cleanup.
> Trace file parsing speedup.
> [Din memory trace](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~markhill/DineroIV/) file support. _**DONE**_

1.2 Spreadsheet and Gnuplot friendly output

1.3 Alternate page replacement algorithms

1.4 Batch trace experiment support
